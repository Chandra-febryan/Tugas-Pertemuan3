                I am the bone of my sword
                Steel is my body and fire is my blood
                have created over a thousand blades
                Unknown to Death,Nor known to Life.
                Have withstood pain to create many weapons
                Yet, those hands will never hold anything
                So as I pray, Unlimited Blade Works.
